## Issues, suggestions and feature requests
Minor issue with the Code Block, where the code is all coloured black, so there's no colour to distinguish different parts of a code snippet.
We are working in improving it and adding features to make this widget more flexible for different purposes. Feel free to suggest us new features and report issues.
